This code replicates and delves into the findings from the original research study, "Short-term Momentum" by Mamdouh Medhat et al.

Our work confirms the study's intriguing patterns in U.S. and international stock returns, specifically:

Double-Sorting Approach: Utilizing a double decile sort based on the previous month's return and share turnover, we re-affirm the existence of unique return dynamics. We observe a strong short-term reversal in low-turnover stocks and an equally powerful short-term momentum in high-turnover stocks.

Short-Term Reversal and Momentum: Our replication indicates that the lowest decile turnover stocks demonstrate significant short-term reversal, while the highest decile turnover stocks display strong short-term momentum. This intricate coexistence of reversal and momentum at a 1-month horizon is at the heart of our analysis.
